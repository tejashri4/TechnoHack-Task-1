# Overview of the Project
# Project: Build a Simple Calculator


This project aims to develop a basic calculator that performs fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator will operate from the command line, allowing users to input numbers and the desired operation. 

**Key Features:**

*   **User-friendly Interface:** The calculator will provide a clear and concise interface for users to input numbers and select the desired operation.
*   **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** It will support the four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   **Error Handling:** The calculator will gracefully handle invalid input, such as non-numeric values or division by zero.
*   **Command-Line Execution:** The calculator will be executed directly from the command line, making it easily accessible and usable.

**Project Goals:**

*   Demonstrate basic Python programming concepts, including:
    *   Function definitions
    *   User input and output
    *   Conditional statements (if-elif-else)
    *   Error handling (try-except blocks)
*   Develop a practical and functional tool for performing simple calculations.
*   Gain experience in building command-line applications.

This project provides a foundational understanding of basic Python programming and problem-solving skills while creating a useful and practical tool.
